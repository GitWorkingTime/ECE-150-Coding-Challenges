# ECE-150-Coding-Challenges

ECE 150 - Programming Fundamentals - offers coding challenges as extra practice. Here are my attempts at them!

Each category will be seperated into its own branch and then merged into main. To try them out, clone this repo and run these commands, assuming that you're in the correct directory

` g++ <filename.cpp> -o <filename> `  
` ./<filename> `

This should compile the file that you're looking for and also to run them in the terminal.

Have fun coding!
