# ECE-150-Coding-Challenges

ECE 150 - Programming Fundamentals - offers coding challenges as extra practice. Here are my attempts at them! 
Of course, I'm not only going to practice using the coding challenges but also content from tutorials or other
online resources. This title is a slight misnomer I realize... but that's okay!

Each category will be seperated into its own branch and then merged into main. 
To try them out, clone this repo and run these commands:

```
1.) cd <directory>
2.) g++ <filename.cpp> -o <filename>  
3.) ./<filename>
```
This should compile the file that you're looking for and also to run them in the terminal.

Have fun coding!
